          <p>
            Presently at a last stage in developing my portfolio.
            Used Angular 6 as the front end and Angular Firebase as the back end.
            Used github.io in order to publish my portfolio.
            Link will be available soon.

            Future Implementations:
            To Implement THREE.js in angular JS to introduce 3D models. And also to provide VR feature.
            Also to use a-frames inside Angular.

          <h2>Prevention of android repackaging attack using AspectJ Oriented Programming</h2>
          <p>
            Android is one of the most popular mobile operating systems in the world. It provides people with great
            convenience. And also It is prone to various security attacks. In this project, With the help of seed labs,
            I had performed a malicious code injection into a Google Play store application, where contacts will be
            deleted when you open this application. So in order to prevent this attack, I had added reference monitors
            to the application using AspectJ. This will detect the malicious code and notify the user about the attack.
